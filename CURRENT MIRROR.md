## Variation observed when current mirror is in certain ratios:





# **Inference :**
- The current mirror circuit accurately copies the reference current with very little variation, ensuring reliable current mirroring across different W/L ratios.
- Even when the W/L ratio changes while keeping the same proportion, the drain current (I<sub>D</sub>) stays nearly the same, confirming the circuit's effectiveness.
- The amplifier gain is slightly higher than expected due to small differences in transistor properties or minor simulation effects.
- When the mirror ratio increases (from 1:1 to 1:2), the gain also increases as expected.
- Overall, the results closely match theoretical predictions, proving that the simulation and circuit design are working correctly.
- When a current mirror is used as an active load in an amplifier circuit, it significantly enhances the circuit's performance by providing a high output resistance and stable current.
- Unlike a passive resistor, the current mirror behaves like a constant current source, which leads to a more stable biasing condition and improves the amplifier’s linearity.
- The high output impedance of the current mirror increases the overall voltage gain of the amplifier, since the gain is directly proportional to the load resistance.
- In differential amplifier configurations, using a current mirror as the load also improves the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), allowing the circuit to better suppress unwanted common-mode signals and amplify only the differential input.
- This behavior is especially advantageous in integrated circuit (IC) design, where space is limited and precision is critical.
- Current mirrors are more area-efficient than large resistors and provide better matching characteristics, making them ideal for high-performance analog designs.

# **Inference :**
- The circuit operates as a differential amplifier based on a current mirror, with the output (Vout) being controlled by the difference between V2 and V3.
- Stable current replication is guaranteed by the PMOS current mirror (M1-M2).
- This circuit is helpful for signal processing and amplification in analog designs because it uses the NMOS differential pair (M3-M4) for amplification.
